### Hello I'm Alfred

I like to tinker with electronics circuits and enjoy creating code for GNU/Linux as well as embedded devices in the realm of physical computing.<br />
**Electronics sometimes turns out to be a field of technology closely related to magic!**<br />
Amateur Radio and Amateur Astronomy also provide interesting activities and exchange of experience.<br />

file_utils is a small collection of Linux based tools which may prove useful.<br />
dsp_stuff is a small collection of code in C and PERL for signal processing stuff.<br />

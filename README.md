### Hello I'm Alfred

I like to play with Electronics, Embedded devices programming and Physics things for the pure fun of it!<br />
**Electronics is a field of technology closely related to magic!**<br />
Amateur Radio and Astronomy are huge fields where I'm trying to be active also from time to time!<br />

Presently I am undertaking my first tentative steps into understanding and using GitHub.<br />
